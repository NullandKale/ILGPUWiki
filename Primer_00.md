# Setting up ILGPU.

ILGPU should work on any 64bit platform that .Net supports. I have even used it on the inexpensive nvidia jetson nano with pretty decent cuda performance. 

Technically ILGPU supports F# but I don't use F# enough to really tutorialize it. I will be sticking to C# in these tutorials.

### High level setup steps.

If enough people care I can record a short video of this process, but I expect this will be enough for most programmers.

1. Install the most recent [.Net SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/visual-studio-sdks) for your chosen platform and/or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) on Windows.
2. Create a new C# project.
3. Add the ILGPU and the ILGPU.Algorithms nuget packages.
4. ??????
5. Profit
